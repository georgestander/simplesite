    <h2>The lady named Bright</h2>

    <p>
        There once was a Lady named <strong>bright</strong> <br>
        whose speed was much faster than <strong>light</strong> <br>
        She set out one day <br>
        In a relative way <br>
        And returned on the previous <strong>night</strong> <br>
        - <strong><i>Anonymous</i></strong>
    </p>
